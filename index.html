      <p>
        <span id="brand">Picky</span> started because the founder 
        <span id="founder">Matias Dusil</span> wanted a place to keep track of his
        ratings for the drinks he had ordered at Starbucks so that he could remember
        what he liked and didn't like.

        With <span id="brand">Picky</span> you can do two main things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose the meal/drink that you ordered at the restaurant/cafe to give
          it a rating. That way you can always refer back to your list and check
          which products you liked most!
        </li>
        <li>
          Look at your friends' favorite products so that you can try what they're
          having!
